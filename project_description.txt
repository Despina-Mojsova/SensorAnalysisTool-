This desktop GUI application detects anomalies in sensor data using Python and MATLAB. It supports multiple detection and filtering methods including Isolation Forest for unsupervised anomaly detection, Autoencoder-based anomaly identification, Frequency spectrum analysis via FFT, and Noise filtering through MATLAB.

Features:

- Generate sensor data before running analysis
- Perform anomaly detection and visualize results
- Export analysis and plots as a PDF report
- Apply noise filtering using MATLAB integration

Application Interface:

- Isolation Forest detects anomalies using the IsolationForest model
- Autoencoder performs anomaly detection with an autoencoder model
- Frequency Analysis displays the FFT spectrum of the signal
- Filter Noise using MATLAB applies moving average filtering
- Generate Report exports analysis results in PDF format

Requirements:

- Python 3.8 or later
- MATLAB required for noise filtering
- Required Python packages listed in requirements.txt

Running the Application:

Before running the application, the sensor data file must be generated using:

python generate_data.py

Once the data has been generated, start the application using:

python data_analisys.py

Project Files:

- generate_data.py is the script for generating sensor data
- data_analisys.py is the main GUI application
- filter_signal.m is the MATLAB script for noise filtering
- README.md and requirements.txt contain documentation and dependencies
